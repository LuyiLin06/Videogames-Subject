Left it is, you trust your instincts.

It seems that you're in a liminal space. Only yellow walls and moist carpet floor. Nothing else. Wow, this place seems to want to confuse you. Anyhow, you have to move, or more like there's a certain instinct that's driving you to move. "You're in danger if you stay still", your body's telling you to get going.

There's a certain static noise playing constantly. At first, you thought it was your ears still being affected by the fall, but now you realize it's just the ambient noise here. To your annoyance, it seems that your adventure throught this maze will be accompanied with a static sound as a soundtrack.

You finally reach a fork, and another choice has to be made. You're not sure wether you would even be able to trace your steps back, this place seems vehement on making you lose your track. Will you leave some marking on the wall to guide you back just in case?

Don't leave marks, and go left

Don't leave marks, and go right

Leave marks, and go left
