Honestly, you don't even know how you got here. You were simply taking a walk only to suddenly fall, and all went pitch black. Did you really just die from a fall? You feel your flesh's pain, as if answering to your own questions. You're still alive, but lost in the unkown.

You're stunned from what felt like an eternal fall. Only the yellow-hued light the roof is emmiting even gets to your hurt pupils and stinging eyes. As your vision gets clearer, the environment reveals itself. 

Walls. Lots of walls. All of the same yellow tones. You try to stand up, and feel the floor sink as you put your hands on it. The smell of human excretions plunges straight into your nostrils, and your palms feel the uncanny warmness of the moist carpet floor.

You finally stand up. Your legs feel sore. Infact, your whole body does. It feels like you could be stretching for hours and still be left with some left-over soreness. The pungent smell has seemed to recede, or perhaps your nose has alreday gotten used to it. You know how well your brain is at accomodating to the environment. The fall seemed to last an eternity, yet it still but a fuzzy memory in your head. Amazing how your brain can block certain things while in situations like this. But now, you need your brain to work properly. Knock yourself awake.

Okay. Good, good. You feel your senses synchronizing once again. Whilst struggling to keep yourself balanced, the walls seem to call you in. The entrance, or whatever you fell through, has disappeared, vanished. You seem to be in an aisle, it's your choice where to go.

Go left
