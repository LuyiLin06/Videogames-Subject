## Cryptocurrency
Crypto is a form of digital currency where, instead of centralized national banks, relies on speculation and incentives to establish its value. This makes Crypto an extremely volatile currency, having experienced drastic drops and rises

## Fungibility
Fungibility refers to the ability of a material to be able to be exchanged by another material of the same value. Official currencies are a good example of it: you can easily exchange 20 euros for 20 euros without it losing any value. As so, a non-fungible object cannot be exchanged identically. Art pieces are non-fungible, for example. There's only one Mona Lisa, so exchanging for a completely equal value is nigh imposible. You can get a replica, but it won't the same.

## So, what are NFTs?
NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token and, as the name implies, they're "tokens" that cannot be transacted.

Before knowing what NFTs are, it's important to understand another concept: **Blockchains**.

Blockchain enables electronic devices to agree on a certain transaction sequence without needing to trust each other. This causes Blockchain to rely on economic incentives, instead of a third party, to verify transactions. This, in turn, allows the existence of a decentralized and public database.

The exhaustive maintenance of Blockchain registres can create fragments of code that can be traced as distinct entities and be trasacted with other users. This fragments are unique, so they become non-fungible.

NFTs can be bought and sold instead of exchanged, like you would with Cryptocurrency. These purchases are verified via ownership transfer of receipts certifying this transaction. You could think of it as buying a Lamborghini, but only receiving the receipt confirming the purchase. NFTs are essentially that, but with a digital URL.
